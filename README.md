# devleague-cyber-playbook

These Git files contain resources I've made to help me get started as a cybersecurity professional. I've built the files over the course of a nine month long cybersecurity course [devleague](https://www.devleague.com/).  

The naming convention in this repository is: 

NameOfDocument_TypeOfDocument_YYYYMMDD

My favorite types of documents are checklists, standard operating procedures (SOP), one-pagers (1Pager), best practices (BP), and (of course!) scripts. These are my favorites, because they are the only types of resources I ever manage to refer back to.  

There is a grey area between a checklist and an SOP, but for simplicities sake I name any document that I've created with checkboxes a checklist. Others, which may have instructions, flow charts, etc. are SOP. 

One-pagers are highly condensed explanations of key concepts. I write them when I have to grok a concept, sector, or technology better. To me, the creator of an ultra-relevent, single page document has obtained a level of mastery over the subject matter and is prepared to speak to the CEO, CIO, or COO at a level that is most important to them.  

Best Practices are hybrids between notes and paragraphs. These documents are in a state of transition. With just a little more effort, they can be further digested into SOP, checklists or one-pagers. I just haven't gotten around to it... yet.
