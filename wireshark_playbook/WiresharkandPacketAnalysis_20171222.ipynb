Sometimes you find that stuff, but you're getting lucky. It won't be a treasure trove. Wireshark captures a snapshot in time. You would have to be capturing as the gun was going off, or at least still smoking. \n",

    "For wireshark the gold is in the standardized information contained in the protocols which allow you to piece together a common operational picture. Once Wireshark has taught you the network paths, operating environment and the actors within it, then use other tools to break in and grab the motherload.  \n",

It pays to know what you want to find and have a plan for how you will find the first frame. Start the capture and when you find what you're looking for, isolate it and filter out other data. Once you've gathered that data, you can always save to file and run another capture to find your next piece of data. Piece it all together with precision and patience. \n",
